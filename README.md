# Warning 

Our public api backend is going down for this app due to the site owner going out of business in this tough economic circumstance unfortunately. I emailed him and he sent me the heroku that will go down October 30th 2023. The api functionality might be defunct at that date. We might also circle back to this as a group and use it as a learn to make your own backend experience, or use postman to craft mock data for the app. Thanks!!!
